# Resources

1. This activity will use the Numbers API: http://numbersapi.com/

2. To review how to use jQuery to select an HTML element and apply a jQuery method, review the jQuery documentation and utilize its search field: https://api.jquery.com/

# Instructions

The purpose of this project is to use async/await by fetching data from the Numbers API. Your project must accept user input that is a number and upon submission of the number, a trivia fact about that number is displayed to the user in the UI.

0. Remember to add your handle to the name of this project!

1. Important: Review the Numbers API documentation in the Resources section to figure out how to get data as JSON.

2. In your HTML file:

2a. Create a field for the user to enter a value. Assign it an id of "num" and have its placeholder text set to "Please enter a number"

2b. Create a button element. Assign it a class of "btn" and have its value set to "Get Trivia!"

2c. Make sure you have included the jQuery CDN tag from the Google Developers Library.

2d. Also ensure that this HTML file has access to the JS file.

3. Set up your JS file:

3a. Split your JS file into 3 sections by creating comments for each heading: Variables, Functions, and Function Executions.

3b. Under each commented out heading is the corresponding code.

4. In each section of your JS file:

4a. Variables: Determine if you have to store information in a variable.

4b. Functions: Determine how to structure your async await function. Refer to the MDN documentation.

4c. Function Executions: Determine what function needs to run when the user clicks on the button.

5. Use Chrome Dev Tools!

5a. Remember that console.log() is your friend. Use it to get the data to display to the user. If questions arise beyond the resource links provided here, feel free to do a Google search and then show up to office hours.

5b. Log the response as well as the promise to the console.

5c. In the Response object, locate the result to find the data that you wish to use to display in the UI.
